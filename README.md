## Objectives
- Identify the factors behind H&M’s delivery delays.
- Measure their impact on key metrics like customer satisfaction and delivery performance.
- Recommend strategies to streamline logistics and reduce delays.

## Process
- Data Collection and Cleaning: We gathered raw data from 1000 customers aged 15-30 in Ontario who reported delivery delays. The data was cleaned to remove outliers and inconsistencies, ensuring accuracy in our analysis. We also processed historical order data over a 9-month period, examining variables such as order processing times, delivery durations, and customer complaints.
- Data Analysis: Using pivot tables and charts, we analyzed delivery patterns and identified common delay trends. We tracked KPIs such as average delivery time, on-time delivery rate, and complaint rate to understand where inefficiencies occurred in the supply chain.

## KPIs Measured
- Average Delivery Time: The actual average was 8.7 days, exceeding the expected 7 days.
- On-Time Delivery Success Rate: 91.7%, indicating nearly 9% of deliveries were delayed.
- Customer Satisfaction Rating: 3.15 out of 5, showing moderate dissatisfaction.
- Complaint Rate: On average, 1249 complaints per day from 15,147 orders.

## Key Findings
- Order Processing Delays: The time taken for picking, packing, and dispatching orders was longer than expected, leading to delayed deliveries.
- Mismatch in Demand and Inventory: Fluctuating fashion trends made it difficult to keep inventory aligned with customer demand, causing stockouts and slowing fulfillment.
- Logistics Inefficiencies: H&M’s current logistics setup did not optimize for speed, especially in the last-mile delivery phase.

## Recommendations
- Partner with Fast Delivery Services: Collaborating with third-party services like Instacart can reduce delivery times and improve last-mile logistics.
- Automate Warehousing: Establishing an automated warehouse in Ontario can improve order processing speed, helping H&M better serve both Canadian and northern U.S. customers.
- Improve Demand Forecasting: Advanced analytics can help predict customer demand, ensuring better stock management and quicker deliveries.
- Enhance Customer Communication: Providing real-time updates and more accurate delivery information can help manage customer expectations and reduce complaints.

## Conclusion
By cleaning and analyzing the data, we identified key inefficiencies in H&M’s delivery operations. Addressing these issues through faster logistics partnerships, automated warehousing, and better forecasting will help reduce delivery delays, increase customer satisfaction, and improve H&M’s overall operational performance in the competitive e-commerce space.
